    "Python is an *object oriented programming (OOP) language*. This is in contrast to *functional programming languages* such as C or Fortran. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Whether a programming language is object oriented or functional does not determine whether it is a compiled or an interpreted language. Python is OOP and traditionally \"interpreted\", while C++ is still OOP but is a compiled language. This distinction is only for convenience though, and [it is possible to construct a compiler or an interpreter for any language](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/245053/277976). \n",

    "Typically when building software/code for an application, we have some sort of entity which we are trying to manipulate/transform/process. This could be taking some data and bundling this into a structure to display, such as in a web query, or a set of files or images and performing some operation on these (compression, archiving, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "The key feature underlying this is that we typically have some form of an underlying structure, possibly a few of these, which are usually distinct and fall into a few sets of distinct objects. These typically have their own set of unique or esoteric operations which we would like to perform. We try to bundling our information and code into these object like structures. The reason for this is because it makes our code easier to read, modify, maintain, and understand. "
