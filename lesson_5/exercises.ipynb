    "### People and family trees.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Write a class which represents a person. This class should be able to store their name, date of birth, address, and other items of personal information. \n",
    " * Add the following features to your class:\n",
    "\t- Compute the age of the person given only their date of birth. \n",
    " \t- Add a field storing the person's parents. \n",
    "\t- Add a field storing the person's children. \n",
    " * Modify your class to incorporate a family tree. Consider implementing the following features:\n",
    " \t- Querying if two people are:\n",
    "\t\t+ Siblings.\n",
    "\t\t+ Married.\n",
    "\t\t+ Related.\n",
    "\t- Adding a person into the family tree (e.g. marriage, birth, adopted). \n",
    "\t- Removing someone from the family tree (e.g. death, divorce).\n",
    "\t- Determining the depth of the family tree. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Tic-Tac-Toe.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can construct the game Tic-Tac-Toe as a class object.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Write a game class. This should have the game name, the maximum number of players, etc.\n",
    " * Add player classes (and possibly a bot class).\n",
    " * Add methods to the game class which starts a match (possibly a new game instance?).\n",
    " \t- Overload the addition operator between games and players to enable players to join the game. \n",
    " * Write a match method which prints the current state of the game. \n",
    " * Add a turn method which will take the input (either from a person or a bot) and will update the match. This will need to check if the move is valid, and also whether this wins/loses the game?\n",
    "\t- If you wanted to enable an \"undo move\" feature, consider what you would need to change in the code. "
