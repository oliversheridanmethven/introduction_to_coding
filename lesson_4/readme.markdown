## Lesson 4

> You'll notice that for this lesson there are `.py` files, 
which are regular source code files. This is dual purpose. Firstly,
source code is easier to write, test, maintain, use with 
version control systems (such as git), and is more portable.
Secondly, real code is not written for demonstrative purposes, but 
is usually designed to 'work under the hood'. Seeing source code
will better prepare you for writing real world code, and setting up 
others people's code for you to use. Nonetheless, some of this 
will be transferred into notebook format for use in class. 

### Description

In this lesson we will introduce:

 * Functions:
    - Variable and keyword arguments.
    - Partial functions. 
    - Vectorised functions.
 * Iterators and generators. 
    - `yield`.
 * Wrappers and decorators.
    - Timing.
    - Memory profiling.
    - Caching.
