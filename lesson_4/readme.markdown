    - Partial functions. 
    - Vectorised functions.
 * Iterators and generators. 
    - `yield`.
 * Classes.
 * Wrappers and decorators.
    - Timing.
    - Memory profiling.
    - Caching.

> You'll notice that for this lesson there is no `ipynb` file, 
but instead only regular source code. This is dual purpose. Firstly,
source code is easier to write, test, maintain, use with 
version control systems (such as git), and is more portable.
Secondly, real code is not written for demonstrative purposes, but 
is usually designed to 'work under the hood'. Seeing source code
will better prepare you for writing real world code, and setting up 
others people's code for you to use.
