## Downloading the project

Download the project and extract the files from GitHub from the folowing link:  
[https://github.com/oliversheridanmethven/introduction_to_coding](https://github.com/oliversheridanmethven/introduction_to_coding)
 
Either copy these files into a new PyCharm project, or create a new pycharm project in this
directory, and then create the project using the contained source files. 

Either of these two methods will allow you to see the project files.
