### Description

Introduction to coding course for Oxford International College.

### Language

Python 2.7. 

>Most of the code will be easily transferable to Python 3, and there may be examples from other languages such as C, JavaScript, etc.

## Git

This project will use *git large file storage* (`git lfs`) for any large files which are not predominantly source code.
(This is easy to install and use on UNIX/LINUX based systems, and should also be installable on MS Windows with the 
appropriate application).

### iPython Notebooks

Much of this code will be written using iPython notebooks. These are useful for interactively demonstrating the results
from running different source code.
