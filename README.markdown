### Description

Introduction to coding course for Oxford International College.

### Questions, issues, bugs, etc.

If you have questions about the course, find bugs in the code,
discover issues running the code, or anything similar, then please
email me at

### Language

Python 2.7.

>Most of the code will be easily transferable to Python 3, 
and there may be examples from other languages such as C, JavaScript, etc.
Before diving into Python, it is useful to install Python (if using MS Windows). 
If you are running UNIX/LINUX/OSX then you will most likely already have this installed. 
To check open the terminal and type in `python --version`. 
In this course we will mostly be using Python 2.7 instead of Python 3. 
This is not a major issue, but there will be some small syntactic differences between the two.
([For more information about *getting started* with Python](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/)).

> *The joy of coding Python should be in seeing short, concise, readable
classes that express a lot of action in a small amount of clear code \-
not in reams of trivial code that bores the reader to death.*
\- Guido van Rossum.

## Git

This project will use *git large file storage* (`git lfs`) 
for any large files which are not predominantly source code.
(This is easy to install and use on UNIX/LINUX based systems, 
and should also be installable on MS Windows with the 
appropriate application).

### iPython Notebooks

Much of this code will be written using iPython notebooks. These are useful for interactively demonstrating the results
from running different source code. 

> I am generally not a fan of coding notebooks, but occasionally they can be useful. 
However, they can be a pain when using VCS (such as git). To circumvent committing the output
of such notebooks, 
[see the instructions on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20844506/5134817).

### Course structure

> This year is the first year that this course has been offered. As such
the syllabus and topics we cover are very flexible, and can be heavily
influenced by the students taking this course. The first few classes will
constitute some of the basic requisites for understanding the building-blocks
of the language, but after that **any suggestions about topics which students
would like me to include (or remove) are encouraged**.

> Currently there is no homework required for this course, although I will
offer various exercises to demonstrate the topics covered. Hopefully you
will find this useful practice and interesting. Feedback on this would be
highly appreciated.

in it.* \- Dennis Ritchie.

than from books.* \- Alan Turing.


#### Lesson 1 - Hello world.

Writing your first program in Python. A comparison of the different programming
languages and how to write hello world in a variety of languages. We also introduce
some of the basics data types, containers, and operators.

#### Lesson 2 - Control flow, I/O, and functions.

We introduce control flow tools like `if  else`,  `while`, and `for`. We also
show how to take use input, either from a file or interactively, and to output
this either to a file or the screen. We also introduce how to define functions
and consider variable scope.

#### Lesson 3 - Packages

We introduce the most commonly used packages in Python:
`numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`. This will introduce the python package
installer `pip`, namespaces, and some nice plotting features.
