    "\n",
    " * Given a list of numbers, sort these into ascending order (without using the python funtion `sorted`).\n",
    "\t- Sort these into descending order.\n",
    " * Find the index of all occurences of an item in a list (if any). \n",
    " * Find the maximum and minimum value in a list. \n",

    "### Advanced numerics.  \n",
    "\n",
    " * Without using division (e.g. `/`, `//`, or `%`) compute 1/7, 1/10, 1/11, and 1/0.5, 1/0.034 up to:\n",
    "\t- 2 significant figures.\n",
    "\t- 6 significant figures.\n",
    "\t- 10 significant figures. \n",
    "> For all the above try binary search. Can you think of a better algorithm (NB - computers don't use binary search for division). \n",
    " * Compute \"pi\" (e.g. 3.1416...) up to 10 decimal places. \n",
    " * Compute \"e\" (e.g. 2.7183...) up to 10 decimal places. \n",
    "> There are many ways to compute these two numbers, try a few. If you're stuck then the series expansions for the two are readily available. Alternatively, I would suggest trying Monte Carlo methods for those of you who may have found this easy. "
